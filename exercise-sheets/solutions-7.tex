    Hint already gives us the graph, we just have to prove it satisfies the
    requirements. So let $(K_n, c)$ be a graph with weights $c(\{i, j\}) =
    \lambda_{i, j}$ (we use $\lambda_{i, j} = \lambda_{j, i}$ $\forall i, j \in
    K_n$ for this to be well-defined) and $T$ be a maximum weight spanning tree
    in $(K_n, c)$. Lets show local edge-connectivities in $T$ are exactly
    $\lambda_{i, j}$.

    Since $T$ is a tree, local edge-connectivity for any pair of vertices is the
    minimum of weights of edges on the path between them.

    Take $i, j \in T$.

    Condition $\lambda_{i, k} \geq \min\{\lambda_{i, j} \lambda_{j, k}\}$
    clearly implies $\lambda_{i, k} \geq \min_{e \in P_{i, k}} \lambda_e$, where
    $P_{i, k}$ is the edge set of the path between $i$ and $k$. This already
    proves that local edge-connectivity for a pair $i, j$ is smaller or equal to
    $\lambda_{i, j}$.

    Now suppose the inequality would be strict. Let $\{k, l\} \in P_{i, j}$ be
    an edge on the path between $i$ and $j$ with $\lambda_{k, l} < \lambda_{i,
    j}$. Then we could simply replace $\{k, l\} \in T$ with $\{i, j\}$ and
    obtain a tree with strictly bigger weight, which contradicts our assumption
    that $T$ is maximum weight.

    Therefore local edge-connectivity is exactly $\lambda_{i, j}$ for every $i,
    j \in T$.
