setup_blossomv.sh:
   Due to blossom5's licensing we are not allowed to publicly distribute it directly. Instead, you should use this
   script to download and build it as a static library.

instances, generate_random_Kn.py generate_instances.sh:
  The instances folders contains some instances generated these two scripts.
  If you want to generate more/new instances, you may need to install python.
  I will generate new instances for testing, so don't overtune to this instances!

src:
  Currently contains example code for finding a minimum weight perfect matching.

.compile.sh:
  simple bash script for compiling. This also downloads and compiles the blossom5 library if necessary (using
  setup_blossomv.sh).


RUN: 
     ./bin/minimum-weight-perfect-matching <dimacs-file> <output-file>
  Example:
     ./bin/minimum-weight-perfect-matching ./instances/K1024.dimacs solution1024.dimacs
